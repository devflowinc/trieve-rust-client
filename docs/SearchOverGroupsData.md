## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**filters** | Option<[**models::ChunkFilter**](ChunkFilter.md)> |  | [optional]
**get_collisions** | Option<**bool**> | Set get_collisions to true to get the collisions for each chunk. This will only apply if environment variable COLLISIONS_ENABLED is set to true. | [optional]
**group_size** | Option<**i32**> | Group_size is the number of chunks to fetch for each group. The default is 3. If a group has less than group_size chunks, all chunks will be returned. If this is set to a large number, we recommend setting slim_chunks to true to avoid returning the content and chunk_html of the chunks so as to lower the amount of time required for content download and serialization. | [optional]
**highlight_delimiters** | Option<**Vec<String>**> | Set highlight_delimiters to a list of strings to use as delimiters for highlighting. If not specified, this defaults to [\"?\", \",\", \".\", \"!\"]. | [optional]
**highlight_results** | Option<**bool**> | Set highlight_results to true to highlight the results. If not specified, this defaults to true. | [optional]
**page** | Option<**i64**> | Page of group results to fetch. Page is 1-indexed. | [optional]
**page_size** | Option<**i32**> | Page size is the number of group results to fetch. The default is 10. | [optional]
**query** | **String** | Query is the search query. This can be any string. The query will be used to create an embedding vector and/or SPLADE vector which will be used to find the result set. | 
**score_threshold** | Option<**f32**> | Set score_threshold to a float to filter out chunks with a score below the threshold. | [optional]
**search_type** | **String** | Can be either \"semantic\", \"fulltext\", or \"hybrid\". \"hybrid\" will pull in one page (10 chunks) of both semantic and full-text results then re-rank them using BAAI/bge-reranker-large. \"semantic\" will pull in one page (10 chunks) of the nearest cosine distant vectors. \"fulltext\" will pull in one page (10 chunks) of full-text results based on SPLADE. | 
**slim_chunks** | Option<**bool**> | Set slim_chunks to true to avoid returning the content and chunk_html of the chunks. This is useful for when you want to reduce amount of data over the wire for latency improvement. Default is false. | [optional]
